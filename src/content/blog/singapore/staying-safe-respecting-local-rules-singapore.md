# Safety and Local Etiquette Guide to Singapore

Singapore is known for its cleanliness, efficiency, and low crime rates, making it one of the safest cities in the world for travelers. However, like any destination, it's important to remain vigilant and informed. In this guide, we will cover essential safety tips, legal matters, cultural respect, and emergency procedures to enhance your experience in this vibrant city.

## Safety

### Neighborhoods to Avoid
While Singapore is generally very safe, there are a few neighborhoods where travelers should exercise increased caution, especially at night. These areas include:

- **Geylang**: Known for its red-light district, Geylang has a reputation for being less family-friendly after dark. While daytime visits are generally safe, it's best to remain vigilant at night.
- **Little India**: Although a popular tourist spot, certain parts can get crowded and chaotic. Stick to main streets and well-lit areas.

### Safe Transportation Options
Singapore boasts a highly efficient public transportation system:

- **MRT (Mass Rapid Transit)**: The MRT is the backbone of Singapore’s transport system, with trains running frequently. A standard ride costs between SGD 0.80 to SGD 2.00, depending on the distance.
- **Buses**: Buses are another reliable option, with fares similar to the MRT. Use the EZ-Link card for seamless travel across both systems.
- **Taxis**: Taxis are safe and metered, but be aware of peak hours when surcharges may apply. A typical fare within the city center is around SGD 10 to SGD 20.
- **Ride-Hailing Apps**: Grab and Gojek are popular ride-hailing options that operate throughout Singapore.

### Crime Statistics Context
Singapore has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, with a reported crime rate of 39.4 per 100,000 residents in 2022. Violent crime is extremely rare, and most incidents involve petty crimes like pickpocketing. Travelers are encouraged to maintain basic safety practices, such as keeping valuables secure and being mindful of their surroundings.

### Common Scams and How to Avoid Them
While scams are rare, here are a few to watch out for:

- **Tourist Traps**: Some businesses may charge inflated prices for tours or services. Always check reviews on sites like TripAdvisor before booking.
- **Fake Charity Collectors**: Sometimes, individuals may approach you claiming to collect for charity. Politely decline and consider donating to recognized charities instead.

## Legal Matters

### Local Laws that Affect Tourists
Singapore is known for its strict laws, and understanding them can help avoid unwanted penalties:

- **Smoking Regulations**: Smoking is banned in most public places, including parks and public transport. Fines can reach SGD 1,000 for violations.
- **Littering**: Littering can result in fines of up to SGD 1,000 for first-time offenders. Always dispose of trash properly.
- **Drug Laws**: Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for drug offenses, with severe penalties including the death penalty for trafficking.
- **Public Behavior**: Public nudity, swearing, and other indecent behavior can lead to fines or arrest.

### Photography Restrictions
While photography is generally allowed, be cautious in certain areas:

- **Government Buildings**: Avoid photographing military installations and certain government buildings, as this might lead to legal issues.
- **Religious Sites**: Be respectful and ask for permission before taking pictures, especially in places of worship.

## Cultural Respect

### Cultural Sensitivities
Singapore is a multicultural society with a mix of ethnicities. Here are some cultural norms to observe:

- **Greeting Etiquette**: A firm handshake is common, but avoid using the left hand, which is considered impolite.
- **Dining Etiquette**: If you're invited to a local's home, it's customary to bring a small gift, like fruit or sweets.

### Appropriate Behavior in Religious Sites
When visiting religious sites such as temples, mosques, and churches, follow these guidelines:

- **Dress Modestly**: Wear clothing that covers shoulders and knees. Some places may provide shawls or sarongs for visitors.
- **Remove Footwear**: Always remove shoes before entering a temple or mosque. Look for designated areas for this purpose.
- **Be Quiet and Respectful**: Keep noise levels down and avoid disruptive behavior.

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Contact Information
In case of emergencies, here are key contacts you should keep handy:

- **Emergency Services (Police, Ambulance, Fire)**: Dial **999** for police or **995** for fire and ambulance services.
- **Non-Emergency Police**: For non-urgent police matters, call **1800-255-0000**.
- **Singapore General Hospital**: Located at 1 Hospital Drive, for any medical emergencies.

### Embassy Details
If you need assistance, contact your embassy. Here are a few key embassies in Singapore:
