In this article, we will explore what makes November an excellent month to visit Singapore, including weather conditions, festivals, tourism levels, and recommendations for making the most of your trip.

## Ideal Weather Conditions

### Temperature and Humidity

In November, Singapore enjoys relatively pleasant weather compared to the sweltering heat of other months. The average temperature ranges from **24°C to 31°C (75°F to 88°F)**. While the humidity can still be high, averaging around **80%**, the temperatures are generally more bearable, especially with the occasional rain showers that help cool things down.

November marks the beginning of the Northeast Monsoon season, and rainfall is common. The island experiences an average of **190 mm of rainfall** during the month, typically falling in short, heavy bursts. It's wise to carry an umbrella or a light rain jacket to stay dry. However, these showers often lead to beautiful, lush landscapes and less crowded attractions.

## Festivals and Events

### Deepavali

One of the main highlights of November is **Deepavali**, also known as the Festival of Lights, which is celebrated by the Indian community in Singapore. In 2023, Deepavali falls on **November 12**. The festival is marked by vibrant street decorations, especially in Little India, where you can experience stunning light displays, traditional Indian music, and dance performances.

Luxury hotels may start at **SGD 300 (USD 220)** but often offer special packages during this time. It's advisable to book in advance to secure the best rates, especially if your trip coincides with Deepavali festivities.
