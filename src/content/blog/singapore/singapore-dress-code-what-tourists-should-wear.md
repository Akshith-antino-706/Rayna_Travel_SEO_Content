## Cultural Considerations and Modesty Expectations
Singapore is a multicultural society, and while it is generally modern and cosmopolitan, respecting local customs and traditions is crucial.

- **Modesty:** In public places, especially near religious sites, it’s essential to dress modestly to show respect.
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** When in doubt, err on the side of caution. If you’re unsure about what to wear, observe locals or ask for guidance.

### What to Leave Behind
- **Heavy fabrics** (like wool) which can cause discomfort in the humidity

- **High heels** that may be uncomfortable for long walks

## Fabric Recommendations
- **Cotton:** Breathable and easy to wash; ideal for daily wear.
- **Linen:** Lightweight and perfect for hot weather, though it wrinkles easily.
- **Moisture-Wicking Fabrics:** Great for active days or in humid weather.
