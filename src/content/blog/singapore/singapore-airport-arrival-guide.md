# Arriving at Singapore Changi Airport: A Complete Guide

Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) is not only a major international hub but also consistently ranked among the best airports in the world. Whether you’re arriving for business or leisure, navigating your way through immigration, customs, and transportation can be seamless with the right preparations. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the arrival process, transport options, currency exchange, and other essential tips for a smooth entry into Singapore.

## Immigration and Customs Process

### Required Documents

Before you land in Singapore, ensure you have the following documents ready:

- **Passport:** Valid for at least six months beyond your date of entry.
- **Visa (if required):** Check if your nationality requires a visa to enter Singapore. Many nationalities can enter visa-free for short stays.
- **Arrival Card:** This can be completed digitally through the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) website or app before your flight. However, paper forms are also available upon arrival.

### Expected Wait Times

Upon landing, you can expect the immigration process to take anywhere from **20 minutes to over an hour**, depending on the time of day and the volume of arrivals. Peak times can be during weekends, public holidays, and evenings. 

If you're arriving on a busy day, consider using the **Automated Immigration Gates** (if you are eligible) which significantly speeds up the process for citizens of Singapore, as well as residents and travelers from certain countries.

### Visa on Arrival

For those who are eligible for a visa on arrival (such as certain passport holders from countries like Afghanistan), you will need to fill out an application at the designated immigration counters. This might add additional time, so plan accordingly. Make sure you have any required documentation and a fee (typically around SGD 30) in cash or credit card ready.
