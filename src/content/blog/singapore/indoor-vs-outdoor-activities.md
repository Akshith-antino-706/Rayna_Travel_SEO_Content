3. **Stay Hydrated:** Always carry water, especially during outdoor activities, and wear sunscreen.
4. **Dress Appropriately:** Lightweight, breathable clothing is essential for the heat. A poncho or compact umbrella can be handy for unexpected rain.

### Flexibility Strategies

- **Time Management:** Allow for flexibility in your schedule. If rain is predicted, plan to switch to indoor activities without feeling rushed.
- **Local Knowledge:** Engage with locals or staff at your accommodation for real-time recommendations based on current weather conditions.
