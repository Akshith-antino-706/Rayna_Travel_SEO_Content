- **Banks**: Leading banks such as DBS, UOB, and OCBC have numerous ATMs located throughout the city.

### ATM Fees and Daily Withdrawal Limits

While many local ATMs do not charge withdrawal fees, international transactions might incur fees from your home bank. On average, expect to pay about **$3 - $5 SGD** per transaction if you’re using an international card. 

- **Daily Withdrawal Limits**: Most ATMs in Singapore allow withdrawals of up to **$500 SGD** per transaction, with a maximum of **$1,000 SGD** per day. However, your home bank may impose its own limits, so check beforehand.

### Safety of Using ATMs

Using ATMs in Singapore is generally safe. Here are some tips to ensure your safety:

- **Choose Busy Locations**: Opt for ATMs situated in well-lit and populated areas, such as shopping centers or bank branches.
- **Check for Skimmers**: Before inserting your card, inspect the ATM for any unusual attachments that could be skimming your card information.
- **Use Card Protection**: Enable alerts from your bank for transactions to monitor any unauthorized activity.

## Currency Exchange Options

### Forex Exchange Locations

### Exchange Rates and Commissions

Exchange rates fluctuate daily, so it’s wise to check rates online through platforms like XE or OANDA before exchanging. As a reference, the average exchange rate for **1 USD** to **1.36 SGD** (as of October 2023).

- **Airport and Hotel Exchanges**: Generally offer worse rates, approximately **5% - 10%** lower than street exchangers.
- **Street Exchangers**: Often charge a lower commission and provide better rates, making them the most cost-effective choice.
- **Banks**: Usually competitive but may charge extra fees, particularly for small amounts.

### Comparing Costs of Exchange Methods

## Tips for Getting the Best Rates

2. **Avoid Airport Exchanges**: Unless absolutely necessary, steer clear of exchanging money at airports.
3. **Negotiate**: Some street exchangers may be willing to negotiate their rates if you’re exchanging a large amount.

## Keeping Money Safe

- **Use Multiple Payment Methods**: Carry a mix of cash and cards. While cash is handy, cards can provide added security.
- **Notify Your Bank**: Inform your bank of your travel plans to avoid any blocks on your card.
- **Carry a Money Belt**: Consider using a money belt or hidden pouch to keep your cash and cards secure while exploring.

## Carrying Cash vs. Cards

While Singapore is a cash-friendly country, many places also accept credit and debit cards. Here’s how to decide:

- **When to Carry Cash**: Small local eateries, hawker centers, and some markets may only accept cash. A safe amount to carry is around **$100 - $200 SGD** for daily expenses.

- **PayPal**: Convenient but may have higher fees for currency conversion.
- **Bank Transfers**: Although secure, they typically have the highest fees and longer processing times.
