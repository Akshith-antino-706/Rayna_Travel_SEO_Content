One of the highlights in June is the **Fête de la Musique**, celebrated on June 21st, coinciding with the summer solstice. This nationwide music festival showcases both amateur and professional musicians performing free concerts throughout the city. From jazz in the Marais to classical music near Notre-Dame, the streets come alive with melody. It’s an excellent opportunity to experience Paris's vibrant cultural scene.

### Outdoor Markets and Picnics
June is also a fantastic time to explore Parisian outdoor markets like **Marché Bastille** (Saturdays) and **Marché des Enfants Rouges** (daily). Stock up on fresh produce, artisan cheeses, and baguettes for a classic Parisian picnic in one of the city's beautiful parks, such as **Jardin des Tuileries** or **Parc des Buttes-Chaumont**.

### Open-Air Cinema
Starting in late June, the **La Villette Open-Air Cinema** kicks off, where you can watch classic films under the stars. Bring a blanket and enjoy a picnic while soaking in the cinematic experience against the backdrop of Paris.

## Impact of Weather on Outdoor Activities and Tourism Levels

### Tourism Levels

Accommodation prices rise significantly in June, with budget hotels averaging around **€120-€250 per night** for a double room. For a more luxurious stay, expect to pay upwards of **€300-€600**. Booking in advance can help secure better rates.

### Managing the Heat
With temperatures sometimes climbing, it’s essential to stay hydrated and wear sun protection. Carry a reusable water bottle to refill at public fountains, and wear light, breathable clothing. If you prefer to escape the heat, consider visiting museums during peak afternoon hours, as many offer air-conditioned indoor spaces.
