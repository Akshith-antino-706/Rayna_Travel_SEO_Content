## Summer Effects on Attractions

Many attractions extend their hours during the summer to accommodate tourists. The Louvre, for example, is open until 9:45 PM on Wednesdays and Fridays. However, this is also the peak tourist season, so expect larger crowds at popular sites like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral. 

**Insider Tip**: Book timed entry tickets online to avoid long queues.

### Seasonal Closures
Some smaller attractions may close for maintenance during the summer months, so check ahead. In August, many locals go on vacation, which can lead to temporary closures of smaller restaurants and shops.
