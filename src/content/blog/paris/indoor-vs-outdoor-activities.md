### Backup Plans for Different Weather Conditions
- **Rainy Days**: If outdoor plans are rained out, consider a wine tasting tour or a cooking class, which can be both engaging and delicious.
- **Hot Days**: Opt for indoor activities like shopping or museum visits in the morning or late afternoon, and plan a leisurely lunch at a shaded terrace.
- **Cold Days**: Warm up with a hot drink at a café, then visit nearby attractions that require minimal outdoor exposure, such as the Palais Garnier.

### Flexibility Strategies for Weather-Dependent Itineraries
1. **Time Block Planning**: Create time blocks that allow for flexibility. For instance, dedicate mornings to outdoor activities and afternoons to indoor pursuits.
2. **Local Insights**: Ask locals for recommendations on attractions that remain enjoyable regardless of weather conditions.
