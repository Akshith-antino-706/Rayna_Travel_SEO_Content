## Appeals and Reapplication Procedures

If your visa application is rejected, you have the right to appeal the decision. Here’s how to navigate that process:

### Appeals Process

2. **Gather Supporting Documents:** Collect documents that address the reasons for rejection.
3. **Submit Appeal:** Follow the instructions provided in the rejection letter on how to appeal. This may involve submitting new forms or additional documentation.

### Reapplication Process
