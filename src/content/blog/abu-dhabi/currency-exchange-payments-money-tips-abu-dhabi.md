Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, is a vibrant city known for its luxurious lifestyle, stunning architecture, and rich cultural heritage. For travelers, understanding the local currency and financial practices is crucial to enjoy a hassle-free visit. This guide provides essential information about using and managing money in Abu Dhabi.

## Local Currency Overview: The UAE Dirham (AED)

The official currency of the United Arab Emirates is the **UAE Dirham (AED)**. The dirham is abbreviated as AED and often represented by the symbol "د.إ". It is subdivided into 100 fils.

### AED Denominations

- **Banknotes:** AED 5, AED 10, AED 20, AED 50, AED 100, AED 200, AED 500, and AED 1,000
- **Coins:** 1 fils, 5 fils, 10 fils, 25 fils, 50 fils, and AED 1

**Tip:** AED 5 and AED 10 notes are handy for small purchases and tipping. Keep a mix of denominations for convenience.

## Best Places to Exchange Money

Exchanging money is straightforward in Abu Dhabi, with numerous options available:

### Airport vs. City Exchange Rates

- **Abu Dhabi International Airport:** Currency exchange counters are available in all terminals. However, airport rates can be less favorable compared to the city.
- **City Exchange Houses:** Better rates are often found at exchange houses in the city. Popular options include Al Ansari Exchange and UAE Exchange, with multiple branches in malls and shopping areas.

**Insider Tip:** Avoid exchanging large amounts at the airport. Instead, exchange a small amount to cover immediate expenses and head to the city for better rates.

## ATM Availability and Fees

ATMs are widespread throughout Abu Dhabi and provide a convenient way to access cash.

- **Availability:** You'll find ATMs at airports, malls, hotels, and major streets.
- **Fees:** International withdrawal fees vary by bank but typically range from AED 20-25 (approximately USD 5.50-6.80) per transaction.

**Tip:** Check with your bank about international withdrawal fees and ensure your card is activated for international use before traveling.

## Credit/Debit Card Acceptance

Credit and debit cards are widely accepted, particularly Visa and MasterCard. American Express is accepted in fewer locations.

- **Hotels, Restaurants, and Shops:** Most of these establishments accept cards, though some smaller vendors might prefer cash.
- **Minimum Spend:** Some places may have a minimum spend requirement for card payments.

**Insider Tip:** Always carry some cash for smaller establishments and taxis, which may not accept cards.

## Digital Payment Apps

Digital payment methods are gaining popularity in Abu Dhabi, with several options available to tourists:

- **Apple Pay and Google Pay:** Widely accepted in many retail stores and restaurants.
- **Local Apps:** Etisalat Wallet and Payit are gaining traction but may require a local bank account for full functionality.

**Tip:** Confirm with your bank that your digital payment apps are set up for international use before your trip.

## Tipping Customs

Tipping is not mandatory but appreciated in Abu Dhabi. Here are some general guidelines:

- **Restaurants:** 10-15% of the bill, if a service charge is not included
- **Hotels:** AED 5-10 (USD 1.35-2.70) for bellboys and housekeeping
- **Taxis:** Round up to the nearest dirham or add a small tip

**Insider Tip:** Check your bill for a service charge before tipping at restaurants.

Bargaining is common in traditional markets (souks) but not in malls or branded stores.

- **Souks:** Feel free to negotiate prices, especially for souvenirs and textiles.
- **Fixed Prices:** In modern retail environments, prices are fixed.
