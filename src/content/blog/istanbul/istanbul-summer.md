## Indoor vs. Outdoor Activities

### Outdoor Activities

Summer is ideal for outdoor exploration, but it comes with heat considerations. Plan your sightseeing for early morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday sun. Consider visiting:

### Clothing and Protection

Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing to allow your skin to breathe. Light colors reflect sunlight better than dark colors, keeping you cooler.

### Health Tips

- Take breaks in shaded areas or indoors to avoid heat exhaustion.
- Be mindful of signs of heat-related illnesses, such as dizziness or fatigue.
- Always carry a small hand fan, which can be a lifesaver in the heat.

- **Radisson Blu Hotel**: Located near Taksim Square, it's a great choice for luxury travelers.

## Best Times to Visit

The best times to visit Istanbul during summer are early June and late August. Early June offers warm weather without the intense heat and crowds of July. Late August sees a slight decrease in tourist numbers as locals return from holidays.
