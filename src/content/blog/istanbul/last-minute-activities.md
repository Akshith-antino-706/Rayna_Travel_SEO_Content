## H2: Tips for Last-Minute Travelers

### H3: 1. Be Flexible

Flexibility is key to enjoying last-minute activities. If a tour is full, don’t hesitate to explore alternatives. The city is full of hidden gems that can provide a fantastic experience.

### H3: 2. Leverage Local Recommendations

Chat with locals or fellow travelers for tips on where to go next. Platforms like **Google Maps** and travel-specific apps can also help you find nearby activities.

### H3: 3. Bring Essentials

Always carry a small backpack with essentials like:
- A water bottle (tap water is safe to drink)
- Sunscreen and a hat
- A portable charger for your phone
- Cash, as some vendors may not accept cards

### H3: 4. Crowd Expectations

Be mindful that Istanbul can get crowded, especially during peak tourist seasons (June to August). Visiting popular sites early in the day or on weekdays can significantly enhance your experience.

### H3: 5. Backup Plans

If your first choice is full, consider alternatives. For instance, if you can't get on a Bosphorus cruise, a walk along the waterfront in **Ortaköy** can still provide stunning views and a lively atmosphere.
