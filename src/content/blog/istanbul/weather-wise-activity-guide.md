### 2. Rainy Weather (Indoor Alternatives)

**Recommended Activities:**

- **Grand Bazaar**: One of the largest and oldest covered markets in the world. Wander through its 4,000 shops, sampling Turkish delight and shopping for souvenirs.

**Rain-Friendly Options**: Always check the weather forecast. Carry a compact umbrella or a light raincoat as rain can sometimes be unpredictable.

### 3. Hot Weather (Beat the Heat)

**Recommended Activities:**

- **Visit Museums**: The Pera Museum and the Istanbul Modern offer air-conditioned spaces to escape the heat while enjoying art and culture.
