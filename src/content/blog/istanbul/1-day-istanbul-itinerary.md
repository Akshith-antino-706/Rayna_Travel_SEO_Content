Start your day with a traditional Turkish breakfast at Café Privato, known for its rich selection of cheeses, olives, fresh bread, and honey. A typical breakfast here costs between 60-90 TL ($3-$5).

Next, head to Hagia Sophia, one of Istanbul's most famous landmarks. Spend about an hour admiring its stunning architecture and mosaics, which blend Christian and Islamic elements.

### **Tip:** 
Midday is a great time to visit as many tourists will be having lunch. Consider taking photos from the outside first, as the lighting is usually good.
