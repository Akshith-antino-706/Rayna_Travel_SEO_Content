## Dress Codes for Specific Venues

### Religious Sites
Bangkok is home to stunning temples, such as Wat Pho and Wat Arun. It’s crucial to dress respectfully.

**Dress Code:**
- **Men**: Long pants and sleeved shirts; avoid shorts and sleeveless tops.
- **Women**: Long skirts or pants, and tops with sleeves; avoid low-cut or revealing clothing.
- **Essential items**:
  - A shawl or scarf can be handy to cover shoulders.
  - Comfortable shoes as you may need to remove them before entering.
  
**Cultural Considerations**: Always show respect by not pointing your feet at Buddha statues and refraining from taking selfies in inappropriate contexts.

### Upscale Restaurants
Bangkok boasts a vibrant dining scene, from street food to luxury restaurants like Sirocco.

**Dress Code:**
- **Men**: Collared shirts, dress pants, and closed-toe shoes; avoid shorts or flip-flops.
- **Women**: Dresses, skirts, or tailored pants with stylish tops; avoid overly casual attire.

**Practical Tip**: Some places may enforce a smart-casual dress code post 6 PM, so always opt for polished clothing if dining later in the evening.

While Bangkok is not directly on the coast, many visitors head to nearby beaches like Hua Hin.

**Dress Code:**
- **Beachwear**: Swimsuits, cover-ups, and flip-flops are appropriate, but ensure you wear a cover-up when leaving the beach.
