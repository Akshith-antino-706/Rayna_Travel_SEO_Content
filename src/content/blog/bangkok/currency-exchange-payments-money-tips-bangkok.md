Bangkok, the vibrant capital of Thailand, is not only known for its rich culture and stunning temples but also for its bustling markets and street food scene. To fully enjoy your visit, understanding the local currency, payment methods, and how to manage your money is essential. This guide will equip you with all the necessary information about handling money in Bangkok.

## Currency Basics

### Local Currency

The official currency in Thailand is the **Thai Baht (THB)**. As of October 2023, the exchange rate is approximately **32 THB to 1 USD**, but rates fluctuate regularly. Always check for the most current rates before exchanging money.

### Coins and Notes

Thai Baht is available in various denominations:

- **Coins**: 1, 2, 5, and 10 Baht coins are common, along with 25 and 50 Satang coins (1 Baht = 100 Satang).
- **Notes**: Banknotes come in 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 Baht denominations. The 20 Baht note is often used for small purchases.

## Exchange Methods

When it comes to exchanging your currency for Thai Baht, there are several options available:

### Banks

**Pros**: Banks generally offer competitive exchange rates and lower fees.

**Cons**: They may have limited hours, typically Monday to Friday, and can be crowded.
