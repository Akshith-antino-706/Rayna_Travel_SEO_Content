- **Emergency Contacts**: Save important numbers like your country’s embassy and local emergency services (Dial 191 for police, 1669 for medical emergencies).

### Female Solo Traveler Considerations
- **Dress Modestly**: While Bangkok is relatively safe, it’s wise for women to dress conservatively, especially when visiting temples.
  
- **Use Trusted Transport**: Opt for reputable ride-hailing services like Grab instead of flagging down taxis, especially at night.
