However, it’s also a time when weather patterns can be unpredictable. In this article, we’ll explore what you can expect from London in August, including weather conditions, seasonal events, and tips for making the most of your visit.

Rainfall can be sporadic, and London does experience **occasional thunderstorms** and heavy downpours, particularly as the city transitions towards autumn. Statistically, August tends to be one of the wetter months, with about **60 mm of rainfall** spread across approximately 12 days. Therefore, packing a light rain jacket or an umbrella is highly advised.

### Monsoon Season or Summer Continuation?

## Impact on Tourism

### Visitor Numbers and Prices

August is peak tourist season in London, primarily due to the school holidays that run from mid-July to early September. Families flock to the city to explore its attractions, which can lead to crowded sites and higher prices for accommodation and activities.
