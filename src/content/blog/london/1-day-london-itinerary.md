## Insider Tips for a Seamless Experience

1. **Beat the Crowds:** Start your day early and visit popular sites right as they open. Weekdays are generally less crowded than weekends.
  
2. **Photography Timing:** The best light for photography is during the golden hour—early morning or just before sunset. If you can, try to capture the London Eye around sunset.

3. **Transportation:** Get an Oyster Card or use contactless payment for easy travel on public transport. Plan your route ahead using the Transport for London (TfL) app.

4. **Prioritize:** If you’re running late, skip the optional Thames River Cruise and head straight to Covent Garden for a quicker experience.

5. **Trade-offs:** If you prefer to avoid walking, consider using the Tube for longer distances. However, walking between attractions allows you to enjoy the city’s streets and landmarks.
