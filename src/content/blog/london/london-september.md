## Weather Conditions: Transition from Summer to Autumn

### September Weather Overview

September in London typically sees a shift from the warm, often humid conditions of summer to the cooler, more temperate weather of autumn. Average daytime temperatures range from **15°C to 22°C (59°F to 72°F)**, although early September can still feel quite summery, with occasional heatwaves.

- **Rainfall**: London experiences an average of **50mm of rain** over the month, which means you can expect a few rainy days. The shifting weather can feel unpredictable; therefore, packing an umbrella or a light rain jacket is advisable.

- **Daylight**: The days start to shorten, with about **12 hours of daylight** at the beginning of the month, decreasing to about **11 hours by the end**. This gradual reduction in daylight can create enchanting evenings perfect for outdoor dining or strolls along the Thames.

### Insider Tip

## Festivals and Seasonal Activities

### Major Events in September

1. **Notting Hill Carnival**: Although it primarily takes place in August, the spirit of the Notting Hill Carnival lingers into early September. If you find yourself in London during the first weekend, the celebration of Caribbean culture, music, and vibrant parades is a must-see.

2. **Open House London**: Held on the third weekend of September, this event allows visitors to explore over **800 buildings** across the city, many of which are typically closed to the public. It's an excellent opportunity to discover hidden architectural gems and understand London's rich history.

### Seasonal Activities

- **Theatre Season**: With the summer crowd dwindling, September marks the start of the new theatre season. Catch a show in the West End for a delightful evening. Ticket prices can range from **£20 to over £100**, depending on the show and seating.

## Tourism Patterns and Pricing

### Tourism Trends in September

September is traditionally a quieter month for tourism compared to the bustling summer. As schools re-open and families return home, you can expect fewer crowds at major attractions. 

- **Visitor Statistics**: The number of tourists typically drops by **20-30%** from August to September. This means you can enjoy popular sites like the **British Museum** and the **Tower of London** with shorter lines and a more relaxed atmosphere.

### Pricing Considerations

- **Accommodation**: Hotel prices can vary significantly throughout the month. Early September can still see summer prices, but as the month progresses, expect rates to drop as demand decreases. Average rates can range from **£100 to £300** per night depending on the area and type of accommodation. Booking in advance can often yield better deals.

- **Attractions and Events**: Many attractions offer discounts for students and seniors. Keep an eye out for London Pass options, which can save you money on entry fees if you plan to visit multiple sites.

### Back-to-School Considerations

With the start of the school year, many families will be preoccupied with settling back into routines. This shift means that attractions will be less crowded on weekdays, making it an ideal time for solo travelers or couples to explore without the hustle and bustle.

## Best Times to Visit

For those looking to experience London in September, the best time is during the first two weeks. The weather tends to be milder, and you can enjoy various festivals without the overwhelming summer crowds.
