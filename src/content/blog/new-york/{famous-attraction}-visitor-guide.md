# Visitor's Guide to the Statue of Liberty

The Statue of Liberty, a global icon of freedom and democracy, is one of New York City's most celebrated attractions. A masterpiece of engineering and artistry, it stands proudly on Liberty Island, welcoming millions of visitors each year. This guide provides comprehensive information to help you make the most of your visit.

## History of the Statue of Liberty

Gifted to the United States by France in 1886, the Statue of Liberty was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue was intended to commemorate the centennial of the American Declaration of Independence and symbolizes friendship between the two nations. Standing 305 feet tall from the base to the tip of the flame, it was designated as a National Monument in 1924 and has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## What You'll See and Experience

Visitors can explore Liberty Island, where the statue is located, and enjoy stunning views of the New York skyline. The pedestal and crown of the statue offer breathtaking panoramic views, while the museum provides rich historical context about the statue's construction and significance.
