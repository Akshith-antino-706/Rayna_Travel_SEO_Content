### Weather Patterns
Expect plenty of sunny days mixed with some overcast skies and occasional rain showers. The evenings can be cooler, making it a pleasant time to explore outdoor dining or nightlife.

## What to Pack

When packing for a summer trip to NYC, consider the following essentials:

- **Lightweight Clothing:** Breathable fabrics such as cotton and linen will help you stay cool. Dress in layers for cooler nights.
- **Comfortable Footwear:** You’ll likely be walking a lot, so choose comfortable shoes.
- **Rain Gear:** A compact umbrella or a light rain jacket can be invaluable.
- **Sunglasses and Sunscreen:** Protect yourself from the sun, especially if you plan to spend time outdoors.
- **Reusable Water Bottle:** Staying hydrated is crucial, and having a water bottle will save you money and reduce plastic waste.

## Impact on Attractions

### Operating Hours and Crowds
Many attractions extend their operating hours during the summer, so you can take advantage of longer days. However, this also means larger crowds:

- **Popular Attractions:** Places like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Times Square can be particularly crowded. Visiting early in the morning or later in the evening can help avoid peak times.
- **Seasonal Closures:** While most attractions remain open, some may have reduced hours or special summer programming. Always check websites for the latest information.

### Available Activities
Summer in NYC is filled with unique experiences:

- **Outdoor Activities:** Central Park offers boating, picnicking, and outdoor concerts. The High Line is another great spot for strolling and enjoying public art installations.
- **Festivals and Events:** Summer Streets, held on Saturdays in August, closes down several miles of city streets for pedestrians and cyclists. The Shakespeare in the Park series at the Delacorte Theater is a must for theater lovers.
  
### Seasonal Products
Don’t miss out on summer-specific products like fresh fruit from local farmers' markets or ice cream from iconic shops such as **Vanilla Ice Cream** on the Lower East Side.

## Indoor vs. Outdoor Activity Suggestions

### Dealing with Heat
If the heat becomes overwhelming, consider indoor activities such as:

- **Museums:** The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History are excellent choices and offer air conditioning.
- **Shopping Malls:** Places like the Westfield World Trade Center or the Shops at Columbus Circle provide relief from the heat.

### Staying Cool
- **Parks with Water Features:** Visit Brooklyn Bridge Park or the splash pads in various city parks to cool off.
- **Indoor Attractions:** Explore the air-conditioned spaces in places like the New York Public Library or visit a rooftop bar for stunning views and a breeze.

## Summer Prices and Tourism Crowds

### Summer Prices
Expect hotel prices to be higher during the summer months due to increased tourism. On average:

- **Mid-range Hotels:** $200-$400 per night
- **Luxury Hotels:** $400 and up

Booking in advance can help secure better rates. Consider staying in areas like **Long Island City** for more budget-friendly options while remaining close to Manhattan.

### Best Times to Visit
The best times to visit NYC in the summer are typically late June or early September when the weather is pleasant, and crowds are slightly thinner. 

## Tips for Staying Healthy in the Heat
