As the summer heat fades, October in New York brings comfortable temperatures ranging from the mid-50s to the low 70s Fahrenheit (around 12 to 22 degrees Celsius). This mild weather is perfect for strolling through Central Park, visiting outdoor markets, or exploring the city’s iconic neighborhoods. 

### Packing Tips
