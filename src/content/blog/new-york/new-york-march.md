## Transitioning Seasons: Impact on Tourism and Prices

March sees a gradual increase in tourism as people begin to shed their winter coats and venture out for spring activities. While the first half of the month may still be quieter due to lingering winter weather, the latter half starts to attract more visitors, especially around St. Patrick’s Day and the onset of spring.
