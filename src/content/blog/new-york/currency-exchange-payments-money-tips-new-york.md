Whether you’re visiting the vibrant streets of New York City for business or leisure, understanding how to manage your money is crucial. This guide will help you navigate local currency, exchange methods, payment options, and safety tips to ensure a smooth experience during your stay.

## Currency Basics

### Local Currency
The official currency of New York City, and the United States as a whole, is the United States Dollar (USD). The currency is denoted by the symbol "$" and comes in various denominations:

- **Coins**: 1 cent (penny), 5 cents (nickel), 10 cents (dime), 25 cents (quarter)
- **Notes**: $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100

### Current Exchange Rates
As of October 2023, the exchange rate fluctuates regularly. To get an idea, 1 Euro (EUR) is approximately 1.05 USD, and 1 British Pound (GBP) is about 1.25 USD. It’s best to check live exchange rates through reliable financial websites or apps like XE or OANDA before you travel.

## Exchange Methods

### Best Places to Exchange Money
When it comes to exchanging your currency for dollars, you have several options:

#### 1. **Banks**

#### 2. **Airport Exchange Counters**
- **Pros**: Convenient and available upon arrival.
- **Cons**: Higher fees and less favorable exchange rates (typically around 5-10% worse).
- **Recommendation**: If you must exchange at the airport, avoid using services like Travelex, which often charge the highest fees.

#### 3. **Street Exchange Vendors**
- **Pros**: Quick and may seem convenient.
- **Cons**: High risk of scams, poor rates, and lack of regulation.

### Tips for Getting the Best Exchange Rates

### ATM Fees
- **Local Bank ATMs**: Typically charge a fee of about $2 to $3 per transaction for non-account holders.
- **International ATM Fees**: Your home bank may also charge a foreign transaction fee, often around 1% to 3% of the withdrawal amount.

### Insider Advice
