# Your Comprehensive Guide to Arriving at Tokyo Airport

Arriving in Tokyo, one of the world's most vibrant and bustling cities, can be an exciting yet daunting experience. Whether you land at Narita International Airport (NRT) or Haneda Airport (HND), knowing what to expect during the immigration and customs process, as well as your options for getting to the city, is crucial for a smooth transition. This guide covers everything you need to know for a successful arrival in Tokyo.

## Immigration and Customs Process

### Documents Required

Before you even step foot off the plane, ensure you have the following documents ready:

### Visa on Arrival

If you need to obtain a visa on arrival, make sure to have all required documentation, including proof of accommodation, return flights, and financial means to support yourself during your stay. This process can take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on how many people are ahead of you.
