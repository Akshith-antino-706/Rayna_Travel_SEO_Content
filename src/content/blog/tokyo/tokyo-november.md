November is one of the most beautiful times to visit Tokyo. The city's vibrant autumn foliage, mild weather, and culturally rich experiences make it a prime destination for travelers. If you're considering a trip to this bustling metropolis, here’s everything you need to know about what to expect in November.

## Weather Conditions in November

### Ideal Weather for Exploring

In November, Tokyo experiences lovely autumn weather. The average temperature ranges from **10°C (50°F)** at night to around **17°C (63°F)** during the day. This is considered mild and comfortable for outdoor activities, making it an excellent time for sightseeing. Rainfall is minimal, with an average of only about **50 mm** throughout the month, so you can expect clear skies and pleasant days.

### What to Wear

Layering is key during this time. A light jacket or sweater will suffice for the daytime, but as evening approaches, you might want to add a warmer coat. Comfortable shoes are essential as you'll likely be walking a lot while exploring the city.

## Festivals and Activities

### Autumn Foliage Viewing

November is peak season for **koyo** (autumn leaves) viewing. Parks such as **Ueno Park**, **Shinjuku Gyoen**, and **Yoyogi Park** are adorned in hues of red, orange, and yellow, providing stunning backdrops for photos. Here are some of the best spots for leaf-peeping:

November is considered a shoulder season for tourism in Tokyo. While it's popular for local visitors to enjoy the autumn foliage, international tourism tends to be moderate.
