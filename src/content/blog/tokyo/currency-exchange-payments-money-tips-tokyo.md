# A Comprehensive Guide to Money and Payments in Tokyo

Tokyo, the bustling capital of Japan, is not only famous for its vibrant culture and delicious cuisine but also for its sophisticated payment systems. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, understanding how to manage your money while exploring this dynamic city is essential. This guide will cover everything you need to know about the local currency, exchange methods, card vs. cash usage, digital payments, and practical cost estimates.

## Currency Basics

### Local Currency

The official currency of Japan is the **Yen (JPY)**, represented by the symbol ¥. As of October 2023, the exchange rate is approximately **1 USD = 140 JPY**, though this rate can fluctuate. It's advisable to check a reliable financial news source or currency converter for the latest rates before your trip.

### Denominations

Yen comes in both coins and banknotes:
- **Coins**: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 yen.
- **Banknotes**: 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 yen.

Coins are widely used in everyday transactions, while larger purchases often require banknotes.

## Exchange Methods

### Best Places to Exchange Money

When it comes to exchanging currency, several options are available, each with its pros and cons.

- **Use Money Belts**: Consider using a money belt or neck pouch to keep your cash and cards safe while exploring.

## Digital Payments
