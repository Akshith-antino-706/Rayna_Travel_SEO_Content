## Your 3-Day Dubai Itinerary Overview

Three days is the sweet spot for a first visit to Dubai — enough time to experience the city's iconic highlights, get a taste of its culture and cuisine, and still come away wanting to return. This itinerary balances modern marvels, cultural experiences, outdoor adventure, and relaxation.

## Day 1: Downtown Dubai & Modern Marvels

### Morning (9 AM - 12 PM)

Start your Dubai adventure at the heart of the city: **Downtown Dubai**. Head to the **Dubai Mall** early (it opens at 10 AM) to explore before the crowds arrive. Don't miss the **Dubai Aquarium** — the massive viewing panel is free from the mall floor, and the underwater tunnel is worth the AED 135 entry. The **VR Park** and **Dubai Ice Rink** are also excellent if you're with kids or teens.

### Lunch (12 - 1:30 PM)

Eat at the **Dubai Mall's food court** for a casual, affordable meal with dozens of options, or step up to **The Cheesecake Factory** or **PF Chang's** for a sit-down experience. For something more local, walk to **Souk Al Bahar** across the footbridge for Arabic cuisine with views of Burj Khalifa.

### Afternoon (2 - 5 PM)

Visit the **Museum of the Future** (AED 149) — its stunning architecture and immersive exhibits on future technology are genuinely inspiring. Allow 2-3 hours. Alternatively, visit **Dubai Frame** (AED 50) in nearby Zabeel Park for panoramic views of old and new Dubai.

### Evening (5:30 PM - Late)

Return to Burj Khalifa for the **At The Top** experience at sunset (book the 5:30 or 6 PM slot for the best light). Watch the city transition from day to night from 555 meters up. After descending, take a prime spot by the **Dubai Fountain** for the evening shows (every 30 minutes from 6 PM). End the evening with dinner at one of the many restaurants around Downtown.

**Day 1 Budget Estimate:** AED 350-500 per person (attractions + food + transport)

## Day 2: Old Dubai, Culture & Desert Safari

### Morning (9 AM - 12:30 PM)

Discover Dubai's heritage in the **Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood**. Wander through the narrow lanes, visit the **Dubai Museum** in Al Fahidi Fort, explore the **Coffee Museum**, and browse the art galleries. The **Arabian Tea House** is a perfect spot for a traditional breakfast (AED 40-60).

Next, take an **abra (water taxi)** across Dubai Creek to Deira (AED 1 — the best bargain in Dubai). Spend time in the **Gold Souk**, where entire shops glitter with gold jewelry, and the nearby **Spice Souk**, where aromatic lanes are filled with saffron, frankincense, and exotic spices.

### Lunch (12:30 - 2 PM)

Eat in the Deira area — **Al Ustad Special Kebab** is a legendary local institution serving exceptional Iranian kebabs since 1978 (AED 30-50 per person). Or try the seafood at **Bu Qtair**, a bare-bones beach restaurant near Jumeirah that serves some of the freshest fish in Dubai.

### Afternoon (2 - 3:30 PM)

Return to your hotel to rest and prepare for the evening — you'll want comfortable clothes and a charged phone for what comes next.

### Evening (3:30 PM - 10 PM)

Your **evening desert safari** pickup arrives around 3:30-4 PM. For the next 6 hours, you'll experience dune bashing, camel riding, sandboarding, a stunning desert sunset, traditional Bedouin camp dinner with entertainment, and shisha under the stars. This is often visitors' single most memorable experience in Dubai.

**Day 2 Budget Estimate:** AED 300-450 per person (safari + food + transport + attractions)

## Day 3: Beach, Marina & Palm Jumeirah

### Morning (8 AM - 11 AM)

Start with a morning at **JBR Beach** — the water is crystal clear, the sand is pristine, and the backdrop of Marina towers is spectacular. Arrive early for the best spots and calmer waters. Rent a sunbed (AED 50-100) or simply lay a towel on the free public section.

For something more active, try **paddleboarding** or **kayaking** from the beach (AED 100-200 per hour), or hit the outdoor gym at **Kite Beach** further along the coast.

### Lunch (11:30 AM - 1 PM)

Walk **The Walk at JBR** — a vibrant beachfront promenade with dozens of restaurants. **Bosporus** serves excellent Turkish cuisine, **Ravi's** nearby in Satwa is a beloved Pakistani restaurant with ridiculously good food at local prices (AED 20-35), or grab a beachfront table at **Tresind** for Indian fine dining.

### Afternoon (1:30 - 4:30 PM)

Take the **Palm Jumeirah Monorail** (AED 30 return) for views of the Palm's fronds and the Atlantis resort. At Atlantis, you can visit **Aquaventure Waterpark** (AED 299, half-day AED 259) or simply walk through the impressive lobby and Lost Chambers Aquarium.

Alternatively, explore **Dubai Marina** — take a leisurely walk along the 7-kilometer Marina Walk, visit the Marina Mall, or jump on a **yellow boat tour** (AED 200) for a speedboat ride through the Marina and along the coastline.

### Evening (5 PM - Late)

For your final evening, head to **Bluewaters Island** (connected to JBR by a pedestrian bridge) to ride **Ain Dubai**, the world's largest observation wheel (AED 130). Time it for sunset for the most spectacular views.

End your trip with a memorable dinner. Options include: **Pierchic** on a pier extending into the ocean (seafood, splurge), **Aprons & Hammers** at Atlantis (casual seafood, moderate), or a **dhow dinner cruise** through the Marina (AED 150-250, includes dinner and views).

**Day 3 Budget Estimate:** AED 350-600 per person (activities + food + transport)

## Pro Tips for 3 Days

Book your Burj Khalifa tickets at least a week in advance — sunset slots sell out quickly. Consider purchasing a Dubai Pass if you plan to visit 3+ paid attractions. Download the RTA (Roads & Transport Authority) app for Metro navigation. Keep Fridays in mind — some attractions have different hours, and Friday brunch at hotels is a beloved Dubai tradition worth experiencing.
