**Supporting Documents:** 
- Application forms
- Passport copies
- Photographs
- Any additional documents requested by the consulate

**Supporting Documents:**
- Criminal record certificate
- Character references (if applicable)

### 7. Overstaying Previous Visas

**Explanation:** If you have overstayed a previous visa in the UAE, it can severely hinder your chances of obtaining a new visa.

## Appeals and Reapplication Procedures

If your visa application is rejected, you typically have the option to appeal the decision. The process usually involves:
