## Dubai Visa Overview

The UAE has progressively simplified its visa processes to encourage tourism, making Dubai one of the more accessible destinations for international travelers. Whether you receive a visa on arrival, need to apply in advance, or benefit from visa-free entry depends on your nationality. This guide covers all scenarios.

## Visa on Arrival (Free Entry)

Citizens of many countries receive a free visa stamp upon arrival at Dubai airport, requiring no advance application. The duration varies by nationality.

### 90-Day Free Visa on Arrival

Passport holders from these regions receive 90 days of stay: All European Union countries, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, and several other nations.

### 30-Day Free Visa on Arrival

Citizens of additional countries including China, Russia, and several Latin American and Caribbean nations receive 30-day visas on arrival. The UAE periodically updates this list, so confirm your nationality's status before travel.

**Requirements for visa on arrival:** A passport valid for at least 6 months from your date of entry, a return or onward flight ticket, and proof of accommodation (hotel booking or host's address). Immigration officers rarely ask for these documents, but having them accessible is prudent.

## Pre-Arranged Tourist Visa

If your nationality doesn't qualify for visa on arrival, you'll need to apply in advance. The most common route is through a UAE-based airline (Emirates, FlyDubai, Air Arabia), a licensed travel agency, a hotel with a dedicated visa desk, or directly through the UAE's official visa service.

### Tourist Visa Types

**30-Day Tourist Visa:** The standard option for most visitors. Single entry, valid for 60 days from issue (you must enter within this window), with a 30-day stay permitted. Cost: AED 300-350 plus service fees, totaling approximately AED 400-550 depending on the processing agent.

**90-Day Tourist Visa:** For extended stays. Similar process to the 30-day visa but permits a 90-day stay. Cost: approximately AED 650-1000 including service fees.

**Multiple-Entry Tourist Visa:** Available as 90-day or 180-day options allowing multiple entries. Useful for travelers who plan to visit neighboring countries and return. Cost varies: AED 1000-1700.

### Required Documents

A completed application form, passport copy (must be valid for 6+ months), passport-sized photograph (white background), confirmed return flight booking, hotel reservation or host details, bank statement showing sufficient funds for the trip duration (typically 3-6 months of statements), and travel insurance documentation.

Some agents may also request: an employer letter or proof of employment, and a cover letter stating the purpose of your visit. Requirements can vary by nationality and processing agent.

## Processing Times

Standard processing takes 3-5 working days. Express processing (1-2 days) is available at additional cost (usually AED 100-200 extra). During peak travel seasons (December-January, Eid periods), processing may take longer — apply at least 2 weeks before your travel date to be safe.

The visa is sent electronically as a PDF to your email. Print a copy to carry with you, and keep the digital version on your phone as backup. Present it to the airline at check-in and to immigration on arrival.

## Visa Extension

If you're on a 30-day visa and wish to stay longer, extensions are possible. Visit any GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs) office or apply online through the ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) smart services. A 30-day extension costs approximately AED 600-900 including fees. Extensions must be applied for before your current visa expires.

Alternatively, some travelers do a "visa run" — a brief trip to a neighboring country (Oman is the most common choice, just a 90-minute drive from Dubai) and re-enter for a fresh visa period. This works for visa-on-arrival nationalities but check current regulations, as policies evolve.

## Common Visa Rejection Reasons

Applications are occasionally rejected. Common reasons include: incomplete or inconsistent documentation, an expired or soon-to-expire passport (less than 6 months validity), insufficient proof of financial means, a previous overstay or immigration violation in the UAE or GCC countries, unclear purpose of visit, and application errors or incorrect information.

If rejected, you can typically reapply after addressing the reason for rejection. Using a reputable travel agent significantly reduces rejection risk, as they review applications before submission and know current requirements precisely.

## Transit Visa

Travelers connecting through Dubai International Airport who wish to leave the airport during a layover can obtain a transit visa. If your layover is under 8 hours, you can typically pass through immigration on a standard tourist visa (for eligible nationalities) or with a pre-arranged transit visa.

A 48-hour or 96-hour transit visa is available for most nationalities, often arranged by your airline (Emirates offers complimentary transit visas for certain itineraries). This allows you to explore Dubai during a longer layover — enough time to see Burj Khalifa, visit a mall, or enjoy a meal in the city.

## Entry Tips

Fill out the arrival card on the plane (or the electronic Smart Gate kiosk). Have your hotel booking and return flight details accessible. Smart Gates at DXB airport speed up immigration significantly for eligible passport holders. Download the UAE's ICP smart app for digital visa status checks. Ensure your passport has at least one blank page for the entry stamp.
