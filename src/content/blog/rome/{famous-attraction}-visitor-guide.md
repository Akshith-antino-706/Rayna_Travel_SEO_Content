# Visitor's Guide to the Colosseum, Rome

The Colosseum, an enduring symbol of Ancient Rome, is not only an architectural marvel but also a testament to the grandeur of the Roman Empire. As you explore this iconic amphitheater, you'll step into a world filled with history, intrigue, and awe.

## History of the Colosseum

Construction of the Colosseum began in AD 70 under Emperor Vespasian and was completed in AD 80 under his successor, Titus. Originally known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, it could hold up to 80,000 spectators who gathered to witness gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, and public spectacles. The structure's innovative design, featuring a complex system of vaults, made it an engineering feat of its time.

After centuries of neglect and damage from earthquakes, the Colosseum has been restored and remains a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors each year.

## What You'll See and Experience

**2-3 hours** is a good amount of time to explore the Colosseum thoroughly, including taking photos and enjoying the exhibits.

## Best Times to Visit
